# Datepicker
Cross-browser date picker calendar. To be used with input elements. Works with IE5+ and modern browsers.

See JS boilerplate for use examples.

This was originally developed for forms being run in compatibility mode that could not take advantage of modern date pickers.
Could be modified to be pure vanilla JS.
